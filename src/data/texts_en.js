Features:
- Double-click to open folders and files.

- Resize windows by dragging the bottom right corner.
- A taskbar that tracks open windows.

export const aboutwebsiteText = `The website is made using create-react-app framework and TailwindCSS.
most of the time I spent coding on this project is the file system and Window Container handling,
so I am quite proud with this project since I made most of structure within 2 days and I still plan to further extend features on this website:

Future ideas for this website
- ContextMenu (you can create folder and txt file with this, also delete it.)
- Mobile Support (when using mobile to access this site, it will emulate android/ios feeling.)
- Add Terminal (the one in the taskbar is still place holder.)
